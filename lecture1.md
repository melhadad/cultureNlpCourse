# Lecture 1

## Technology and Culture
* Application of scientific knowledge to the practical aims of human life
	Materials - ways and means to control the environment
	Energy
	Food
	Construction
	Transportation
	Health
	Information / Social 

* Scientific Paradigms transformations
  * Agriculture
  * Energy: wood, coal, electricity
  * Print 
  * Transportation: horse, donkey, camel, boat, train, car
  * Materials: metal, plastic, concrete
  * IT
    * Computers / 1980s
	* Internet / 1990s
	* Mobile / 2000s
	* Social Media / 2010s
	* AI (Artificial Intelligence) / 2020s

* Mutual influence of Culture and Technology
  * Emerging AI technology - specifically generative models - questions cultural categories.
  * Objectives of the course:
    * Understanding of AI technology - principles, methodology, processes, driving interests
	* Question possible impact on culture and society:
	  * Harm (what is harm, can it be quantified, defined, recognized)
	  * Bias and prejudice
	  * Fairness
	  * Diversity and Uniformity
	  * Responsibility
	* Learn to decipher research papers related to AI and Society
	* Develop practical competency in using AI tools

## Language

* Linguistics: scientific study of language: form, meaning, usage.
* Descriptive
  * Language was first documented in systematic manner about 5,000 years ago (Mesopotamia, Sumer) - Sanskrit and Chinese 2,500 years
    * Focused on list of words.
  * Aristotle 2400 years with study of Rhetoric - Arabic and Hebrew grammars 1,200 years.
* End of 19th Century: Ferdinand de Saussure established modern linguistics as an autonomous discipline - with the field of semiotic within structuralist approach.
  * Phonology, Morphology, Syntax, Semantics - synchronic vs diachronic.
  * Evolved to more sub-fields: psycho / socio / computational / cognitive approaches

* Levels of analysis:
  * Sound (phonology)
  * Word (morphology)
  * Sentence (syntax)
  * Discourse
  * Semantics
  * Pragmatics

* Signifier / Signified (Form / Content)
  * Ambiguity
  * Variability

### Computational Linguistics - History: 

* Representation (Formal Languages) 1960-1990
* Probabilistic models 1990
* Machine Learning 2000
* Deep Learning 2010


## Current State of AI and NLP

* AI = Artificial Intelligence - allows machines to perform tasks which require human intelligence
* NLP = Natural Language Processing (also known as Computational Linguistics).  Allows machines to perform tasks involving language.
  * Machine Translation
  * Speech to text
  * Text to image
  * Spell checking
  * Information Retrieval (ranking, paraphrases)
  * Information Extraction 
* All AI research currently relies on Machine Learning

* Machine Learning:
  * Supervised ML: 
	* Dataset: list of pairs (input, output)
	  * Preparation of datasets requires human effort (annotation)
	  * Modern Datasets require many examples (100Ks to millions)
	* Dataset split: training, development, test
	* Model: characterized by a set of abstract parameters and an optimization algorithm.
	* Objective function: determines how close a candidate output is to the expected output.

	* Examples
	  * Classification: topic, spam, sentiment...
	  * Information Extraction: named entity recognition, relation extraction
	  * Parsing: convert text to structured representation (tree, graph, code)
	  * Generation: generate text conditioned by context (structured or text)

* Deep Learning
  * Specific form of ML
  * Neural Networks: specific algorithm for learning
